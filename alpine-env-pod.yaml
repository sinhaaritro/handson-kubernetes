# alpine-env-pod.yaml

# --- HIGH-LEVEL GOAL ---
# This Pod is a "test harness" designed to demonstrate every major way of consuming
# configuration data (from ConfigMaps) and sensitive data (from Secrets).
#
# The most important feature of this file is that every single data source is marked
# with 'optional: true'. This tells Kubernetes, "If you can't find this ConfigMap
# or Secret, don't fail the Pod; just skip it and continue." This allows us to
# create the Pod first and then create the configuration resources one by one.

      # The alpine image will exit immediately if it has no work to do. This command

      # PART 1: INJECTING DATA AS ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
      # ==============================================================================
      # 'envFrom' is a powerful shortcut. It takes all key-value pairs from a source
      # (like a ConfigMap or Secret) and makes each one an environment variable.
      envFrom:
        # --- Method 1: ConfigMap from 'kubectl create --from-literal' ---
        - configMapRef:
            # 'name' specifies the name of the ConfigMap to look for.
            name: cm-from-literal
            optional: true

        # --- Method 3: ConfigMap from 'kubectl create --from-env-file' ---
        - configMapRef:
            # The name of the new ConfigMap we will create from the .env file.
            name: cm-from-env-file
            optional: true

      # ==============================================================================
      # PART 4: MOUNTING WITH SPEC FILES
      # ==============================================================================
      # --- Method 5.1 (Spec): ConfigMap from kind's 'kind: ConfigMap' ---
      # Only the key mentioned will be loaded from the manifest rest will be ignored
      env:
        - # The name of the environment variable inside the container.

      # ==============================================================================
      # PART 2: MOUNTING DATA AS FILES IN VOLUMES
      # ==============================================================================
      # This is a two-step process:
      # 1. Define the data source in the 'volumes' section at the bottom of the Pod spec.
      # 2. Mount the defined volume into a specific directory here in 'volumeMounts'.

      volumeMounts:
        # --- Method 2.1 (Mount): ConfigMap from 'kubectl create --from-file' ---
        - # 'name' is a nickname that MUST match a volume defined in the 'volumes' section below.
          # This is the link between the data source and the mount point.
          name: single-file-volume
          # 'mountPath' is the directory INSIDE THE CONTAINER where the files will appear.
          mountPath: /config/from-single-file
          # It's a best practice to mount configuration data as read-only.
          readOnly: true

        # --- Method 4.1 (Mount): ConfigMap from 'kubectl create --from-file' with full directory---
        - name: directory-files-volume
          mountPath: /config/from-directory
          readOnly: true

        # --- Method 5.2 (Mount): ConfigMap from kind's 'kind: ConfigMap' ---
        - name: manifest-files-volume
          mountPath: /config/from-manifest
          readOnly: true

  # ==============================================================================
  # PART 3: DEFINING THE VOLUMES (THE DATA SOURCES)
  # ==============================================================================
  # The 'volumes' section defines a pool of storage volumes available to this Pod.
  # Here, we define volumes whose content comes from our ConfigMaps and Secrets.
  volumes:
    # --- Method 2.2 (Volume): ConfigMap from 'kubectl create --from-file' ---
    - # The nickname that 'volumeMounts' uses to refer to this volume.
      name: single-file-volume
      # 'configMap' specifies that this volume's data comes from a ConfigMap.
      configMap:
        # The name of the ConfigMap to use as the source.
        name: cm-from-single-file
        # If this ConfigMap doesn't exist, the Pod will still start, but the
        # '/etc/configmap/file' directory will be empty.
        optional: true

    # --- Method 4.2 (Volume): ConfigMap from 'kubectl create --from-file' with full directory ---
    - name: directory-files-volume
      configMap:
        name: cm-from-directory
        optional: true

    # --- Method 5.3 (Volume): ConfigMap from kind's 'kind: ConfigMap' ---
    - name: manifest-files-volume
      configMap:
        name: cm-from-manifest
        optional: true

  # We use 'Never' for test pods like this that are not meant to be restarted by Kubernetes.
  restartPolicy: Never
