# network-debug-pod.yaml
#
# --- GOAL ---
# This manifest creates a simple "client" Pod that we can use to run network
# commands from *inside* the cluster. This allows us to test connectivity
# to our internal Services like 'webapp-service'.

apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: network-debug-pod
spec:
  containers:
    - name: debug-container
      # We use 'nicolaka/netshoot', a powerful image that includes many networking
      # tools like 'curl', 'ping', and 'dig', perfect for debugging.
      image: nicolaka/netshoot

      resources:
        # 'requests' are the minimum resources the Pod needs to be scheduled.
        requests:
          memory: "64Mi" # 64 Mebibytes of memory
          cpu: "250m" # 250 millicores (one quarter of a CPU core)
        # 'limits' are the maximum resources the container is allowed to use.
        limits:
          memory: "128Mi" # 128 Mebibytes of memory
          cpu: "500m" # 500 millicores (half of a CPU core)

      # This command just keeps the container running so we can 'exec' into it.
      command: ["sleep", "3600"]
